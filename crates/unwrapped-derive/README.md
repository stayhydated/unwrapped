# unwrapped-derive

Procedural macro implementation for `#[derive(Unwrapped)]` and `#[derive(Wrapped)]`.

This crate registers the derive macros and delegates all code generation to `unwrapped-core`. It is an implementation detail of the `unwrapped` crate. Use `unwrapped` directly instead of depending on this crate.
